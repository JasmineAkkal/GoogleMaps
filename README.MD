Google Map Assignment

In this project I have tried to use the Google maps and its functions. I have created few flags like “DistributionFacility”, “CallCenter”, “RetailLocation”, “HeadQuarters” and assigned a hard coded latitude and longitude to the flags to place which is taken by the HTML to place those flags on the respected locations and show a radius around the flags to determine the flag. There is also a legend to name the flags. The idea behind this was to showcase the use of Google maps and its functionalities and how they can be used in more real-time scenario.
